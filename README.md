# AutomatedTwitchToTwitter

My first Project on Python.
It downloads the top 5 twitch clips of every streamer you want and it uploads them to twitter.

Set it up:
  - Install tweepy library
  - Set the twtich ID of the channels you want get the clips from
  - Set your Keys & Tokens to use Twitch and Twitter API
  - Set the minimum views required for the download

Enjoy!
